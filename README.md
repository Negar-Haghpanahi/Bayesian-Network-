 Naïve Bayes model for detecting spam emails
To create a Naïve Bayes model for detecting spam emails, follow these steps:

Introduction
Spam email detection is a common problem in the field of machine learning and natural language processing. This project aims to build a Naïve Bayes classifier to detect spam emails.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 300 spam emails and 300 non-spam (ham) emails for training. Additionally, 400 email samples are provided for testing the model's performance.

Data Preprocessing
All data preprocessing steps, including reading email text from files, removing stop words, tokenizing, vectorizing, and selecting the top features for training, have already been prepared for you.

Implementation Steps
Data Preprocessing: Ensure you have two sets of data, one for training (600 emails) and one for testing (400 emails).

Naïve Bayes Algorithm Implementation: The Naïve Bayes algorithm is used to classify emails into spam or non-spam categories.

Training Naïve Bayes Model: The train_naive_bayes function calculates prior and conditional probabilities for spam and non-spam emails based on the training dataset.

Classifying Emails: The classify_naive_bayes function assigns a spam or non-spam label to an email based on the calculated probabilities.

Usage
Load the preprocessed data, including training and testing datasets.

Train the Naïve Bayes model using the train_naive_bayes function.

Use the trained model to classify emails from the testing dataset using the classify_naive_bayes function.

Optional Enhancements
Performance Metrics: Consider using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance. Document the advantages and disadvantages of each metric.

Confusion Matrix: Visualize a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance in detail. The scikit-learn library can help you create a confusion matrix.

Notebook and Resources
You can use the provided Google Colab notebook to work on this project. Remember to make a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive and share it with the necessary permissions. Use the notebook to write and execute your code. A 15-minute instructional video is available to assist you in implementing the Naïve Bayes algorithm.

Conclusion
Spam email detection is a crucial task in email communication. By implementing a Naïve Bayes classifier, you can effectively distinguish spam from non-spam emails, helping users maintain a clean inbox.
